### What I learned
HTML is something that you need to focused on. If you miss one then the design will be messed up. In Javascript, you can't take your eyes off even for a second or else  the interactives wont work. CSS is free but even inputting the wrong commands can messed up the page layout, colors and font. Even a junior challenge requires great knowledge and logic and focus. Creating this has improved my focus and knowledge regarding HTML,Javascript and CSS.

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development
I will need to focus on broadening my knowledge about HTML, CSS and Javascript as a whole because these components complement each other.
Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
